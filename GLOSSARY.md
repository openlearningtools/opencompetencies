<a name="top"></a>Open Competencies - Glossary
===
It is important to have a glossary, so that we all share a common understanding of the terms used to design this tool.  The final site should have a public-facing glossary, but for now this is an internal document so that developers are on the same page.

In competency-based education, or competency education for short, each student is given a map of all the things they could learn in high school.  Based on each student's post-high school goals, we specify the learning targets that each student needs to meet.  When a student meets all of their learning targets at the appropriate [performance level](#performance_level), they graduate.  There is no ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade; if a student takes two years to finish their map, they graduate in two years.  If they take six years, they graduate in six years.

Traditional education models treat time in school as a constant, and learning as a variable.  So at the end of twelfth grade everyone has been at school for roughly the same number of years, but people have a huge range of skills and knowledge.  Within a class, Algebra 1 for example, everyone spends roughly the same amount of time in class but comes away with very different levels of knowledge, understanding, and skills.  Competency education flips this; it treats what is to be learned as a constant for each person, and lets them take whatever time they need (or don't need) to meet their own learning targets.

The definition of an academic “subject area” may seem obvious, but it is important to define this term as we bring non-academic subjects into the system.  It is fairly straightforward to define the traditional academic subject areas such as Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and English.

One of the advantages of a comprehensive system such as Open Competencies is the freedom we have to define anything and everything we might like young people to learn.  We want to value important skills such as programming, and important character traits such as honesty and reliability.  Which subjects do these traits and skills fall under?  A well-structured system forces us to answer this question, and answering this kind of question frees us to bring anything we identify as important to student success into the system.

<a name="subdiscipline_area"></a>subdiscipline area
---
These are the sub-areas of a subject.  For example, if Science is a subject area, then Physical Science is a subdiscipline area.  So we have:
- Science (subject area)
    - Physical Science (subdiscipline area)

A subject area does not need to have any subdiscipline areas.  Subdiscipline areas may also be referred to as subject disciplines.

<a name="competency_area"></a>competency area
---
A competency area is a major area of learning within a subject area, or a subdiscipline area.  For example, "Experimental Design" would be a competency area of Science, while "Motion and Forces" and "Structure of Matter" would be competency areas of Physical Science.  We would have:

- Science (subject area)
    - *blank*
        - Experimental Design (competency area)
    - Physical Science (subdiscipline area)
        - Motion and Forces (competency area)
        - Structure of Matter (competency area)

There should probably be three to five competency areas within any subject area or subdiscipline area.

<a name="essential_understanding"></a>essential understanding
---
An essential understanding is a specific idea within a given competency area.  We get to define the grain size and format of our essential understandings, to have better internal consistency in our own system than some existing standards documents have.

Essential understandings are the big ideas that relate to a competency area.  They are specific, but still a little bigger-picture than individual learning targets.

Example:
- Science (subject area)
    - Physical Science (subdiscipline area)
        - Motion and Forces (competency area)
            - Newton's Laws describe the motion of most objects. (essential understanding)

<a name="learning_target"></a>learning target
---
A learning target is a specific idea within an essential understanding.  These are all of the facts and concepts that a student needs to know in order to demonstrate mastery of an essential understanding.  The "grain size" of a learning target can vary.  This is the level at which we probably want to implement infinite nesting.

Example:
- Science (subject area)
    - Physical Science (subdiscipline area)
        - Motion and Forces (competency area)
            - Newton's Laws describe the motion of most objects. (essential understanding)
                - I can state Newton's First Law. (learning target)
                    - I know that when forces are balanced, an object does not undergo any acceleration. (learning target)
                    - I can solve problems involving an object moving at a constant speed. (learning target)
