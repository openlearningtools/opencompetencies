Vision
-------
Open Competencies is a dynamic list of all the information you could learn.  It is a tree of knowledge, with different relationships identified between all of the bits of knowledge.

How do you use it?  Let's say you want to be a professional programmer.  You click a button, and all of the bits of knowledge needed to be a programmer light up.  You realize you don't just want to be a programmer.  You  also want to write really well, not just about technical topics.  So you click a few buttons that describes how you want to use writing in your life.  All of the bits that relate to writing well light up.

A separate tool will let you take a copy of your learning targets, and track your progress in learning them.  That needs to be a separate tool, because it requires a different kind of security model.

Use Cases
---------
- You are a school that wants to implement competency education.  You interview new students as they come into your school.  You make a map of what each student needs to learn during their time in high school.  When they finish their map, they graduate from high school.
- You are a parent.  You use Open Competencies to help your child figure out what to focus on in their learning.
- You are a recent college graduate.  No one is telling you what to focus on anymore.  You use Open Competencies to lay out your lifelong learning goals.

Other problems addressed by Open Competencies

Programmers have been using vim and emacs to make their work more efficient since the 1970's, while most teachers are still using Word to write curriculum.  This makes the education world about 40 years behind the open source programming world in terms of efficiency.  This project will bring some of the workflow efficiency of the open source world into the realm of professional educators:
- Forking:  Any school can fork any other schools set of pathways through the learning targets.  It should be possible, actually, to fork the entire set of learning targets itself.
- Continuous Revision:  Education standards are typically created by a small group of educators working for a specified time period.  Whatever they create stands until they can get together again to revise their work.  Open Competencies allows for continuous revision of the entire set of learning targets.
